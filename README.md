# decode-hello

A brand new algorithm for solving Hello World. Instead of brute-forcing the
characters one-by-one, this algorithm decodes them all in parallel.

## Building

The building process is simplified to three steps.

### 1. Building musl

Musl is the default libc used by `decode-hello`. To build, follow these steps:

```
cd lib/musl
./configure
make
```

That's it!

### 2. Configuration (optional)

You can choose your configuration with these env args:

`DELAY_SEC` The delay that is needed in each iteration of the algorithm, in
order to prevent the cpu from melting.  Default: `0` (seconds).

`DELAY_NSEC` See above. Default: `5000000` (nanoseconds).

`RANDOM_IGNORE` Improve accuracy by randomly ignoring N + 1 out of every 256
positive results.  We don't want unlucky results, they're definitely false
positives.  Default: `127` (128 out of 256).

Simply type these options after the `make` command in the next step, as
described there.

### 3. Building!

You can choose to build in release mode or debug mode.

To build in debug mode, type:

```
make
```

It's that simple!  Optionally append your custom configuration to the command,
like shown in this example:

```
make RANDOM_IGNORE=200
```

To build in release mode, type:

```
make RELEASE=1
```

Like previously, you can append your custom configuration to the tail of this
command.

## Usage

To use this program, simply type `./hello`, followed by any number of strings
that you would like printed.  For example, if you'd like to see the solution to
the infamous `"Hello, world!"`-problem, type this:

```
./hello 'Hello, world!'
```
